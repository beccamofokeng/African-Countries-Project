**Data Used**-African Countries I downloaded from Kaggle.


**Data Cleaning and Analysis**-MySQL and Power Query.


**Data Visualisation**-Power BI.


I used African coutries data to gather information about the distribution of the population 
in Africa between the year 2000 and 2022.

I analysed the data based on only 50 countries as the remaining 4 countries had a lot of missing 
information and couldn't be used.

**Summary of Findings**


1.Africa is divided into four parts that is the Eastern part,Western part, Northern part 
and Southern part.The Eastern part has more countries hence most population and the 
Southern part has fewer countries resulting in lower population.

2.I divided the data into top 10 richest countries and top 10 poorest countries which could mean that 
birth rate is greater than mortality rate.

3.The overall population in Africa has been increasing from the year 2000 to the year
2022.

4.I also divided the countries according to East,West,North and South parts 
of Africa to find out the number of countries in each part of Africa.
